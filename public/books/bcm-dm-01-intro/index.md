This textbook is a part of the accompanying material for the Baylor College of Medicine's Data Mining course with a gentle introduction to exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and visual data analytics. Throughout the training, you will learn to accomplish various data mining tasks through visual programming and use [Orange](http://orangedatamining.com), our tool of choice for this course. 

These course notes were prepared by [Blaž Zupan](https://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en/about-faculty/employees/blaz-zupan) and [Janez Demšar](https://fri.uni-lj.si/en/about-faculty/employees/janez-demsar). Special thanks to [Ajda Pretnar Žagar](https://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en/about-faculty/employees/ajda-pretnar-zagar) for the earlier version of the material. Thanks to [Gad Shaulsky](https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/gad-shaulsky-30425) for organizing the course.
