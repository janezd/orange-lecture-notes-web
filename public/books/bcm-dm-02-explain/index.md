This textbook is a part of the accompanying material for the Baylor College of Medicine's Data Mining course with a gentle introduction to exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and visual data analytics. Throughout the training, you will learn to accomplish various data mining tasks through visual programming and use [Orange](http://orangedatamining.com), our tool of choice for this course. 

These course notes were prepared by [Blaž Zupan](https://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en/about-faculty/employees/blaz-zupan) based on the older textbook designed in collaboration with [Janez Demšar](https://fri.uni-lj.si/en/about-faculty/employees/janez-demsar) and [Ajda Pretnar Žagar](https://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en/about-faculty/employees/ajda-pretnar-zagar). Thanks to [Gad Shaulsky](https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/gad-shaulsky-30425) for organizing the course. We would like to acknowledge all the help from the members of the [Bioinformatics Lab](http://biolab.si) at [University of Ljubljana](http://www.uni-lj.si), Slovenia.
