These lecture notes are designed as accompanying material for the xAIM master's course. The course provides a gentle introduction to exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and visual data analytics. Students will learn how to accomplish various data mining tasks through visual programming, using [Orange](http://orangedatamining.com) as our tool of choice for this course.

The notes were prepared by [Blaž Zupan](https://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en/about-faculty/employees/blaz-zupan) and [Janez Demšar](https://fri.uni-lj.si/en/about-faculty/employees/janez-demsar). Special thanks to [Ajda Pretnar Žagar](https://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en/about-faculty/employees/ajda-pretnar-zagar) for the earlier version of the material. We would like to acknowledge all the help from the members of the [Bioinformatics Lab](http://biolab.si) at [University of Ljubljana](http://www.uni-lj.si), Slovenia.
